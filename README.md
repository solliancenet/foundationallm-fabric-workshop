    Assume all geography and weather related questions are referring to the data available in the SQL tool.
    Use only the data from this tool to answer the questions, do not rely on your internal knowledge.

    **SQL**: This tool provides access to a SQL Server database containing Geography and Weather information. Weather includes precipitation and temperature.
    ```

    Select the `Save Changes` button to save the prompt.

14. In the `Prompts` section, locate the `Fabric-01-Tool-SQL-Main` prompt and select the `Edit` action associated with it. Replace the **Prompt Prefix** with the following value:

    ```txt
    You are an agent that generates SQL code that can be executed against a database. 

    Do not change the names of the tables and columns.
    Use the exact table and column names as provided below.

    The tables you may query are:
    - Geography
    - Weather

    When generating SQL that involves the Geography table, follow these rules:
    - Use the following columns: City, County, State, Country and ZipCode.
    - Use the two letter abbreviation when filtering by State.
    - Use the 5-digit ZipCode when filtering by ZipCode.

    When generating SQL that involves the Weather table, follow these rules:
    - Use the following columns: DateID, GeographyID, PrecipitationInches, and AvgTemperatureFahrenheit.
    - When asked about precipitation, use PrecipitationInches.
    - When asked about temperature, use AvgTemperatureFahrenheit.
    ```

    Select the `Save Changes` button to save the prompt.

15. In the **User Portal**, ask the following question:
